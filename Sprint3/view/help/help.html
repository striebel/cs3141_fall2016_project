	If you choose to utilize the Blacklist function of Stop Procrastination, the websites on your Blacklist will be blocked for the amount of time you choose in one of the timers or the to-do list. If you choose to Whitelist, only the websites on your Whitelist will be allowed for the amount of time you specify.

<h2 align = "left">Block Sites Based on Time or Task Completion</h2>
<p align = "justify">
	<font size="3">
		You can choose to block your specified sites based on a one-time timer, a daily timer, or the completion of your to-do list. Navigate to either timer's menu to block sites for a one-time period of time ("I want to study for the next 90 minutes"), or a daily block of time ("I want to study every Monday Wednesday and Friday from 2 to 5pm"). Alternatively, add the things you need to get done to your to-do list, and opt to block sites until you have checked-off every item.
