<h2 align = "left">Basic Timer</h2>
<p align = "justify">
	<font size="3">
The Basic Timer allows you to specify an amount of time for which you would like to current block-type to persist. Once the Basic Timer elapses, the block-type will be set to No-Block. The timer may be set, viewed, and canceled from the main popup menu. The Basic Timer cannot be set when a Daily Timer interval is active.
	</font>
</p>

<h2 align = "left">Daily Timer</h2>
<p align = "justify">
	<font size="3">
Stop Procrastination's Daily Timer adds a level of sophistication to the Basic Timer by allowing recurring time intervals to be set when blacklisting or whitelisting will be active. For example, the Daily Timer could be set so that blacklisting will be active from 3-6pm on Mondays. The Daily Timer supports any number and combination of intervals, so long as no two intervals overlap. The Daily Timer can be edited under the settings menu's "Daily Timer" tab.
